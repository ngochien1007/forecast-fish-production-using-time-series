# Forecast Norway Fishery Production using Time Series Techniques

*This is a project that my team and I accomplished when studying the subject of **Business Analytics** at UIT. My primary responsibilities are to dive deep into **descriptive statistics** and **2 machine learning algorithms** (ARIMA and RF)*.

## Problem Statement

Forecasting fishery production of three species: Northeast Arctic cod, Northeast Arctic haddock, and Atlantic halibut using time series analysis techniques. The project studied and applied **10 algorithms** mentioned below:
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) 
- Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
- Linear Regression (LR)
- Random Forest (RF)
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 
- Sequence-to-Sequence Network (2Seq2)
- Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)

## Dataset

The datasets used in this research project were extracted from a comprehensive log of fishing activity provided by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. It contains information on offshore fishing trips by Norwegian fishing vessels since 2000 in the Norwegian Sea of the North Atlantic. The data is updated daily and includes information on fishing time, location, gear used, and catch quantity for each species of marine life.

The data used for forecasting in this study was taken from **2000** to **2023** on the catch of three common fish species in the region: **Northeast Arctic cod**, **Northeast Arctic haddock**, and **Atlantic halibut**. These species were chosen because they are common, have good data coverage, and are economically important. The development of forecasting models for these species will be valuable for fishermen.
